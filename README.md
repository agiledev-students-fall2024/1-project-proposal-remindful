# Project Proposal
 
# Project Title: Remindful

# What and Why?
*Remindful* is an app designed to help people who struggle with focus, organization, and motivation -- like remote workers and students. The app functions as a smart calendar and productivity tool, offering AI-powered scheduling, mindfulness tips, and emotional support. The goal is to address common problems like attention deficiencies, task overload, and procrastination. By offering personalized guidance and encouragement, *Remindful* helps users manage their workload while maintaining mental wellness, ultimately improving their productivity and well-being.

# For Whom?
*Remindful* is designed for real people facing challenges in managing their time and focus. This includes remote workers, who often lack the structure of a traditional office environment, and students, who may struggle to balance coursework, personal life, and self-care. The app is also intended for individuals with attention disorders, such as ADHD, who benefit from structured support and reminders. These end-users will benefit from *Remindful*'s ability to streamline their scheduling, promote mindfulness, and offer real-time emotional support to keep them motivated.

# How?
From an end-user perspective, *Remindful* works as a dynamic calendar and productivity tool. Users input tasks via AI chat, which seamlessly schedules them into the calendar while resolving conflicts. The app also suggests mindfulness activities based on gaps in the user’s schedule, like “meditate for 10 minutes” or “take a hydration break.” The built-in time tracker provides an overview of how users spend their day, categorizing time for work, personal activities, and mindfulness. Additionally, the emotional support widget can be added to the home screen, offering real-time affirmations or motivational prompts when the user feels unmotivated or distracted.

# Scope
*Remindful* is a manageable project for a team of 4-6 programmers to develop within one semester. The core functionalities—AI-based scheduling, mindfulness suggestions, time tracking, and the support widget—are ambitious but feasible when divided into iterative sprints. The project complexity lies in integrating AI for scheduling and emotional support, but this can be broken down into manageable components. If incorporating ai does turn out to be too challenging, the project could be shifted so that ai is not needed and pre-configured tips, suggestions, and affirmations that still provides users with motivational support to ensure the app remains valuable.
